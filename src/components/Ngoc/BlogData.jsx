      Choosing the right electric fan goes beyond picking one that simply looks good. Comfort, air circulation, 
      and energy consumption all depend on making the right choice.

      **1. Understanding Airflow (CFM)**

      Airflow, measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM), indicates how much air the fan moves. For a small 
      bedroom, 1,000–2,500 CFM is sufficient, while larger living rooms may require 2,500–4,000 CFM. Too 
      low, and the air won't circulate properly; too high, and it may feel uncomfortably windy.

      **2. Room Size and Fan Type**

      - Small rooms: Desk or table fans.
      - Medium rooms: Tower fans with oscillation.
      - Large rooms: Pedestal or high-velocity fans.

      **3. Energy Efficiency**

      Look for Energy Star–rated models that consume less power. Adjustable speed controls allow you to use 
      only the amount of airflow needed, lowering electricity costs.

      **4. Noise Levels**

      If using in a bedroom or office, choose fans with brushless motors and aerodynamic blades for quieter 
      performance.

      **Conclusion**
      The right fan balances airflow, energy use, and noise. By matching the fan to your space and usage needs, 
      you’ll enjoy comfort without unnecessary costs.

    title: "Vacuum Cleaner Buying Guide: Suction Power, Filters, and More",
    description: "Learn how to choose a vacuum cleaner that fits your home, cleaning habits, and health needs.",

      Selecting a vacuum cleaner can be overwhelming with so many models available, from uprights to 
      robot vacuums. Understanding your needs will help you make a better investment.

      **1. Suction Power and Wattage**

      More wattage doesn’t always mean better suction. Airflow and sealed suction are key metrics. Look for 
      models with strong cyclonic suction to handle dust and pet hair effectively.

      **2. Filtration System**

      HEPA filters trap 99.97% of particles, crucial for allergy sufferers. Washable filters save on 
      replacements, but must be cleaned regularly.

      **3. Vacuum Types**

      - Upright: Best for large carpeted areas.
      - Canister: Good for mixed surfaces and tight spaces.
      - Robot: Convenient for daily maintenance.
      - Handheld: Quick spot-cleaning.

      **4. Noise and Weight**

      Lightweight vacuums are easier to maneuver, and low-decibel motors reduce disturbance.

      **Conclusion**
      
      A good vacuum cleaner matches your flooring type, lifestyle, and health concerns, ensuring 
      cleaner air and surfaces.

    title: "Air Purifiers: How to Choose the Right One",
    description: "A detailed guide to air purifiers, filter types, CADR ratings, and how they impact your indoor air quality.",
    image: process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/img/blog-air-purifier.jpg",
    date: "2025-04-20",
    content: `
      Indoor air quality affects your health more than you might think. Air purifiers remove pollutants, 
      allergens, and odors, but choosing the right one is key.

      **1. CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate)**
      CADR measures how quickly the purifier cleans air. A higher CADR is better for large rooms.

      **2. Filter Types**
      - HEPA: Best for allergens.
      - Activated Carbon: Removes odors and gases.
      - UV-C: Kills bacteria and viruses.

      **3. Room Size**
      Always match the purifier’s capacity to your room size for optimal performance.

      **4. Maintenance**
      Check filter replacement schedules. Washable pre-filters extend HEPA life.

      **Conclusion**
      For better health, choose an air purifier suited to your room size, filtration needs, and maintenance 
      preferences.

      Water heaters are essential in modern homes, but the choice between tank and tankless systems can 
      greatly affect cost, efficiency, and convenience.

      **1. Tank Water Heaters**

      Store hot water in a tank, available on demand. Lower upfront cost but higher standby heat loss.

      **2. Tankless Water Heaters**

      Heat water on demand, reducing energy waste. Higher initial cost but long-term savings.

      **3. Energy Use**

      Tankless systems can save 20–40% on energy bills, especially for smaller households.

      **4. Lifespan**
      
      Tank: 8–12 years. Tankless: 20+ years with proper maintenance.

      **Conclusion**
      Choose tankless for efficiency and longevity, or tank type for lower upfront investment.

      Filters are the heart of an air purifier.

      **1. Use Pre-Filters**
      Catch larger particles before they reach the HEPA filter.

      **2. Regular Cleaning**
      Dust off vents and outer surfaces.

      **3. Replace on Schedule**
      Even washable filters lose efficiency over time.

      **Conclusion**
